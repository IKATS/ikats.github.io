        <h1>IKATS in 60 words...</h1>

        <p>IKATS (Innovative Tool-Kit for Analysing Time Series) is the result of a [R&D Data Science Project](/genesis.html) and has been carried out
            in collaboration with the   <a href="http://ama.liglab.fr/">LIG</a> (Laboratoire Informatique de Grenoble) team.
</p>
<P>            IKATS provides a READY2USE toolkit for the handling,
            exploratory analysis and visualization of large volumes of Time Series (TS) data within a single Big Data framework.</p>
</p>
<P>            For a general overview, please, take a look at the
                      <a href="/doc/Plaquette_IKATS.pdf">IKATS booklet</a>.
</p>
          </p>  If you are interested in a second time to investigate and interact with IKATS without get involved in a long installation process,
          let start play with the sandbox :

        <h1>Beautiful, Fast, Efficient, simple and powerful Timeseries Data Analytics</h1>
              <!-- <span class="fa-li fa-lg fa fa-gears"></span> -->
              <p>Data Scientists, Data Engineers use IKATS to explore and generate predictive models making it possible on a second hand
                to supervise manufacturing industry production lines or to help operate hi-tech industrial
                  systems relying on networks of sensors.</p>
                <p>Whatever industries you work on like aeronautics, energy, rail and manufacturing, analysing, exploring and elaborating predictive models from
                   Time Series is a burden in the Data Science domain. With the introduction of IKATS, you can now "keep your eyes" on your data.
