IKATS Origins
=============

IKATS is the result of a R&D project subsidized by the French Government, via the investment program of the "Programme d'Investissement d'Avenir (PIA) « Cloud Computing & Big Data » ".
The R&D IKATS Project is being conducted from January 2015 until September 2018.

The consortium included our company Communication & Systèmes associated with two research teams of the laboratory <a href="https://www.liglab.fr ">LIG (Laboratoire Informatique de Grenoble) </a> : the  dAta analysis, Modeling and mAchine learning team <a href="https://www.liglab.fr/en/research/research-areas-and-teams/ama"> AMA</a> team and the Engineering Human-Computer Interaction
Research Group <a href="http://iihm.imag.fr/en/">IIHM</a>.

The AMA team was created in LIG in January 2011 to work on machine learning and information modeling for complex data. Within this framework, the team is interested in developing new theoretical tools, as well as new prototypes to be deployed in classification or simulation settings, for example. The research activity in the AMA team is structured around the following three main themes:

- Data Analysis and Learning Theory,

- Learning and Perception Systems,

- Modeling Social Networks.


Two important industrial groups participated as end-users, by taking part in use case definition in the filed of predictive maintenance, providing data sets (time series) for IKATS testing and validation and attending strategic Committees :

and

The project was sponsored by the regional clusters ![Aerospace Valley](/img/logo_aese.png ){: .center-image, width="100px" }  and ![Minalogic](/img/logo_minalogic.jpg ){: .center-image" }

The project was followed and monitored by ![DGE](/img/logo_DGE.png ){: .center-image, width="100px" }.
