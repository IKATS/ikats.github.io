IKATS Origins
=============

IKATS is the result of a R&D project which has been subsidized by the French Government, via the investment program of the "Programme d'Investissement d'Avenir (PIA) « Cloud Computing & Big Data » ".
The R&D IKATS Project has been conducted from january 2015 until september 2018.

The consortium included Communication & Systèmes associated to two research teams : the  dAta analysis, Modeling and mAchine learning team <a href="https://www.liglab.fr/en/research/research-areas-and-teams/ama"> AMA</a> team and the Engineering Human-Computer Interaction
Research Group <a href="http://iihm.imag.fr/en/">IIHM</a> of the laboratory <a href="https://www.liglab.fr ">LIG (Laboratoire Informatique de Grenoble) </a>.

The AMA team (dAta analysis, Modeling and mAchine learning) was created in LIG in January 2011 to work on machine learning and information modeling for complex data. Within this framework, the team is interested in developing new theoretical tools, as well as new prototypes to be deployed in classification or simulation settings, for example. The research activity in the AMA team is structured along the following three main themes:
*Data Analysis and Learning Theory,
*Learning and Perception Systems,
*Modeling Social Networks.

Two important industrial groups participated as end-users, by taking part in use cases definition in predictive maintenance domain, providing data sets (time series) for IKATS testing and validation) and attending strategic Committees :  ![AIRBUS R&D](/img/logo_AIB_RetD.png ){: .center-image, width="600px" } 'AIRBUS R&D' and ![EDF R&D](/img/logo_EDF_RetD.png ){: .center-image, width="600px" } 'EDF R&D' .


The project was sponsored by the regional clusters ![Aerospace Valley](/img/logo_aese.png ){: .center-image, width="600px" } 'Minalogic' and ![Minalogic](/img/logo_minalogic.png ){: .center-image, width="600px" } 'Arespace Valley'
