IKATS Key Features List
=======================

The workbench and interface
---------------------------

IKATS is a Visual environment to help Data scientists design workflow accelerating Big Data exploration.

* Easy2Use Web based graphical environment
* No programming required
* Visual representation to design complex Data mining
    * Easy to understand: Every step is an operator
    * Easy to use: design faster
    * Easy to re-use: Workflows can become an operator
* Intelligent and intuitive Visualisation
    * Data Visualisation is part of the operator
    * One can select interesting data from plots, graphs and/or tables and mine them.
    * Big-Data Visualisation tool, like hierarchical tree (from the LIG)
* Extensible
    * Through open APIs (Notebook/Jupyter) to support scripting
    * Add-ons: add your own operators
* Intelligent scoring
    * Machine learning operator provides automatically scoring



Data Manipulation
----------------
A choice of operators dedicated to the import and selection of data, in the form of dataset, timeseries or tables.


Data Visualization
-------------------
Operator outputs offer specific visualizations.
* One can select interesting data from plots, graphs and/or tables and mine them.
* Big data Visualisation tool allows to explore TS with huge amounts of points, by zoom and dag capabilities.


Data Mining
----------------
Operators currently managed by IKATS toolkit (spark), so computations are parallelized using spark library.


Data Management
---------------
With IKATS, you can load timeseries data in different **DataSets** associated with meta Data.
* Timeseries dedicated
* Import/export data values
* Automatically storing all intermediaries workflow values.

Processing
----------
Unlike other predictive analytics tools, IKATS is a Web Based application to provide you with the State of the Art Big Data capabilities performances.
* `All processing are Server Based in cluster environment` -> Architecture based on microservices,
Local full installation
* Execution multiple processes in parallel
* Distributed algorithms (Spark)
