IKATS Key Features List
=======================

The workbench and interface
---------------------------

IKATS is a Visual environment to help Data scientists design a workflow accelerating Big Data exploration.

* Easy-to-Use Web based graphical environment
* No programming required
* Visual representation to design complex Data mining
    * Easy to understand: Every step is an operator
    * Easy to use: design faster
    * Easy to re-use: Workflows can become an operator
* Intelligent and intuitive Visualisation
* Extensible
    * Via open APIs (Notebook/Jupyter) to support scripting
    * Add-ons: add your own operators
* Intelligent scoring
    * Machine learning operator provides automatic scoring



Data Manipulation
----------------
A choice of operators dedicated to the import and selection of data, in the form of dataset, timeseries or tables.


Data Visualisation
-------------------
Operator outputs offer specific visualisations.
* Navigation between different visualisations,
* Interesting data can be selected from plots, graphs and/or tables and be mined.
* Exploring TS with huge amounts of points, by using zoom and dag capabilities.
* Big data specific visualisation tools, such as heatmaps

Explore the list of operators via [Operators list](/operators.html).

Data Mining
----------------
Operators currently managed by IKATS toolkit (spark), so computations are parallelized using spark library.


Data Management
---------------
With IKATS, you can load timeseries data in different **DataSets** associated with metadata.
* Timeseries dedicated
* Import/export data values
* Automatically store all intermediary workflow results.
